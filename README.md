# ML Explainability Demo with PlotSense (UCI Dataset)

## üìå Overview
This demo shows how to:
1. Load and clean a **real dataset** (Breast Cancer Recurrence from UCI).
2. Train a simple ML model (Random Forest).
3. Use **PlotSense AI** to recommend and generate visualizations.
4. Get AI-driven explanations of the results.
5. (Optional) Explore advanced explainability (partial dependence & counterfactuals).

This project is a **starter demo** for hackathon participants.
