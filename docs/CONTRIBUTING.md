## üåü Ways to Contribute

We welcome all types of contributions:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Found something that doesn't work? Let us know!
- ‚ú® **Feature Requests**: Have ideas for improvements? Share them!
- üìù **Documentation**: Help improve our guides, tutorials, and examples
- üß™ **Tests**: Add test cases to improve code reliability
- üíª **Code**: Fix bugs, add features, or optimize performance
- üé® **Examples**: Create new demo projects or enhance existing ones

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PlotSenseAI-Hackathon-Demo-Projects.git
cd PlotSenseAI-Hackathon-Demo-Projects

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Havilah-Blockchain-Studios/PlotSenseAI-Hackathon-Demo-Projects.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv dev-env
source dev-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dev-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install plotsense pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter streamlit pytest

# Install development dependencies
pip install black flake8 pre-commit
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow Python best practices and PEP 8 guidelines:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 .

# Run before committing
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Key Style Points**:
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow existing code patterns in each project

### Documentation Standards

**For Code**:
```python
def zscore_anomaly_detection(data, threshold=1.5):
    """
    Detect anomalies using Z-score method.

    Args:
        data (list or pd.Series): Numeric data for analysis
        threshold (float): Z-score cutoff for anomaly detection

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with anomaly detection results

    Example:
        >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]
        >>> result = zscore_anomaly_detection(data, threshold=2.0)
        >>> print(result[result['anomaly'] == True])
    """
```

**For Markdown**:
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Add emoji for visual appeal (sparingly)
- Provide context and explanations
- Include troubleshooting sections

### Testing Requirements

**For New Features**:
```python
# tests/test_new_feature.py
import pytest
from plotsense_anomaly import new_feature

def test_new_feature_basic():
    """Test basic functionality"""
    result = new_feature([1, 2, 3])
    assert len(result) == 3

def test_new_feature_edge_cases():
    """Test edge cases"""
    # Empty data
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        new_feature([])

    # Single value
    result = new_feature([5])
    assert len(result) == 1
```

**Run Tests**:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_detection.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=plotsense_anomaly
```
